      Hey! I'm TayLynn Harman, I go by TayLynn or Tay! I am married to the Local
      High school golf coach Brigham Harman. :) We got married in February of
      this year! My husband is from Tetonia, and I am from originally from
      Highland Utah. We like to fish, ride horses, golf, and smoke on our
      Traeger.

      I am pursuing a degree in Accounting. I love math and organizing things so
      it is fun to learn. I am currently focusing on school so in my free time I
      do part time jobs. Usually this means I am creating content for social
      media managers. I help run a website that sells merchandise so it would be
      highly beneficial to know how to alter the html so we can customize our
      website.
    </p>
    <p>I am thrilled to be taking this class with all of you! Good luck!</p>
